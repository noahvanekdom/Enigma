# Enigma

**Functionality:**

--- 3 ---
I completed the encrypt and decrypt methods successfully, and was able to interface with them successfully via CLI
runners. I was not able to create a crack method, which will be the next addition to the project (following grading/presentation).

**Object Oriented Programming**

--- 2.5 ---
A module has been created, but was frankly not necessary as it only includes one method. Classes are not broken out into smaller classes, and the enigma class has multiple functions (encrypt, decrypt). Methods are longer than necessary. No method completes more than 1 purpose.

**Ruby Conventions and Mechanics**
--- 3.2 ---
Indenting and formatting has been corrected by rubocop, no class is excessively long, methods are all shorter than 10 lines. Some efficient enumerables have been used (.map.by_index specifically), but methods could still be shorter/broken out into helper methods to make code more easily readable. Code is repeated in nearly identical fashion in multiple places, but would not become inherently DRYer with additional classes/modules.

**Test Driven Development**
--- 2.7 ---
Tests are regularly written before code, but do not test all edge cases, and some unit tests are missing. Testing does not institute mocking or stubbing at a highly successful/adept level. Some obvious edge cases are tested, and tests clearly lay out the required functionality of the code. Test coverage is 100%.

**Version Control**
--- 3.0 ---
Over 30 commits, and multiple clearly named branches. Commit messages are consistently formatted and provide a fairly clear picture of what changes were made. No more than commits are bulky and include multiple pieces of functionality, although there is some confusion in commit history when work was almost lost. Pull requests relate directly to the function of the associated work, and are fairly easy to work back through. Some pull request comments are vague and unhelpful.
